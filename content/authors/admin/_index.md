I’m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Specialist with over 5 years of hands-on experience developing scalable ML solutions and extracting insights from complex, high-dimensional datasets. I am passionate about creating impactful solutions, especially in the healthcare and finance sectors, and I am always keen to learn and grow in areas that merge ML and real-world applications. 

I graduated from my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Western University where I developed a weakly supervised anomaly detection model for surveillance videos using a Two-Stream I3D Convolutional Network as my thesis. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University, focusing on real-time tracking systems.

My research interests include ML fundamentals, Computer Vision, Biomedical Computing, and natural lanaguage processsing. On the applied side, I'm interested in ML problems at scale, modelling, training, deployment and evaluation. I am currently looking for my next job opportunity in machine learning.
