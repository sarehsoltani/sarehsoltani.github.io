abstract:  Our increasingly connected world continues to face an ever-growing number of networkbased attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an essential security technology used for
detecting these attacks. Although numerous Machine Learning-based IDSs have been proposed
for the detection of malicious network traffic, the majority have difficulty properly detecting and
classifying the more uncommon attack types. In this paper, we implement a novel hybrid technique
using synthetic data produced by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to use as input for
training a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model. Our GAN model is trained on the NSL-KDD
dataset, a publicly available collection of labeled network traffic data specifically designed to support
the evaluation and benchmarking of IDSs. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that training the
DRL model on synthetic datasets generated by specific GAN models can result in better performance
in correctly classifying minority classes over training on the true imbalanced dataset.
