title: Medibot: Generative AI Medical Chatbot
summary: Architected and deployed a scalable LLM Medical Chatbot featuring an end-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. The system integrates Hugging Face Sentence Transformers for dense vector embedding generation and Pinecone for low-latency semantic search. It orchestrates OpenAI models via LangChain, implementing custom history-aware retrievers to manage conversational state and reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in verified medical datasets. I engineered the serving layer using Flask and built a production-grade CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, automating testing and deployment directly to AWS EC2 infrastructure.
