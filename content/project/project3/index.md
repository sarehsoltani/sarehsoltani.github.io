title: Weakly-supervised Anomaly Detection in videos
summary: This project introduces a cutting-edge approach to anomaly detection in urban surveillance systems using Two-Stream Inflated 3D (I3D) Convolutional Networks. By capturing both spatial and temporal features more effectively than traditional methods, our model significantly improves detection precision. Leveraging a weakly supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework, we treat surveillance videos as collections of ranked clips, enabling efficient anomaly identification with minimal manual labeling. Optimized for real-world deployment, this scalable and high-performing solution sets new standards in public safety technology through intelligent, context-aware video analysis.
