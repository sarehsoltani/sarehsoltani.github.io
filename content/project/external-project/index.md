summary: Leveraging scVI—a generative variational auto-encoder designed for single-cell RNA-seq—I processed ~14k peripheral-blood cells (16k genes) from patients spanning mild to severe respiratory infection. After stringent QC, normalization, and feature selection, scVI learned a 30-D latent space that accounts for UMI over-dispersion, zero inflation, and donor-specific batch effects, enabling unbiased cross-patient comparisons. The embeddings separated three major immune branches—lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and platelets—and resolved over 10 biologically validated subtypes (CD4⁺ T, T reg, NK, classical and non-classical monocytes) with a macro-F1 of 0.92, delivering a high-resolution snapshot of circulating immune dynamics during respiratory infection.
