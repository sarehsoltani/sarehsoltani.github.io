title: Immune Cell type Annotation from scRNA-seq Blood Data Using scGPT
summary: Built an end-to-end transformer-based pipeline to classify ~20K blood cells from scRNA-seq data, identifying ~10 immune subtypes using scGPT embeddings, clustering, and marker gene validation. Preprocessing included HVG selection and canonical immune marker validation. Results highlight the potential of large-scale generative models for high-resolution immune profiling. \ Tools: HuggingFace, scGPT, scVI, sciPy, scanPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
