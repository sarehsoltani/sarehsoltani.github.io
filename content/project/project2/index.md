title: Real-Time ECG Heartbeat Classification
summary: Built a real-time ECG heartbeat classification system using CNNs trained on the MIT-BIH dataset. The model automatically extracts key temporal ECG features and was optimized with Optuna, with experiments tracked via MLFlow for robust performance. Deployed as a scalable REST API on AWS EC2, the system accepts CSV inputs and delivers fast, accurate predictions, achieving 95% accuracy in classifying arrhythmias. This end-to-end solution enables cardiologists and researchers to analyze their own data in real-world healthcare settings, improving clinical diagnosis through efficient, scalable arrhythmia detection.
